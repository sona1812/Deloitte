# Deloitte Data Analytics Virtual Internship

# Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze unified telemetry data collected from four Daikibo factories over the month of May 2021 to identify patterns of machine breakdowns. Specifically, the analysis aims to determine:
Which factory location experienced the most machine breakdowns, and
Which specific machine types contributed most to the downtime in that location.
This insight will help Daikibo improve its predictive maintenance strategy, reduce downtime, and enhance operational efficiency across its global manufacturing units.

# Tools and Concept Used
* **Power Query (Excel)**
  Imported and transformed **raw JSON telemetry data into structured tabular format.**
  Created calculated columns to identify and quantify machine **unhealthy status (10 mins per event**).
  Converted timestamps into **readable Date-Time format using Unix epoch transformation.**
* **Excel (Advanced Pivot Tables & Dashboarding)**
